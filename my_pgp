DESCRIPTION

The MESSAGE is read from standard input
  CRYPTO_SYSTEM
    "xor"       computation using XOR algorithm
    "aes"       computation using 128-bit AES algorithm
    "rsa"       computation using RSA algorithm
    "pgp-xor"   computation using both RSA and XOR algorithm
    "pgp-aes"   computation using both RSA and 128-bit AES algorithm

  MODE
    -c          MESSAGE is clear and we want to cipher it
    -d          MESSAGE is ciphered and we want to decipher it
    -g P Q      for RSA only: Don't read a MESSAGE, but instead generate a public and private key pair from the prime number P and Q

  OPTIONS
    -b          for XOR, AES and PGP, only works on one block. The MESSAGE and the symmetric key must be the same size

  key Key used to cipher/decipher MESSAGE (incompatible with -g MODE)"""
